# collectiveTransportLiterature
This repository is a collective community effort to share transportation literature.
Within this repository, scientific and grey literature is stored that describes and analyzes transportation data. 
The repo is structured in different strands of analysis the borders of which are somewhat arbitrary and subject to discussion
on the openmod-trans email list. The current differentiation is as follows

- electric mobility
- transportation demand

The repository is maintained by Niklas Wulff (niklas.wulff@dlr.de), don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions.
